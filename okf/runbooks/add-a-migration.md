# Add a schema migration to the project database

## Trigger

A change to the SQLite schema for a per-project `data.db` is needed — a
new column, a new table, or a shape fix to a table already shipped in a
released version — and `0001_initial.ts` can no longer be edited in place
because published installs already carry data created from it as
shipped.[^migration-0001]

## Steps

1. **Decide ALTER-and-backfill vs. drop-and-recreate.** Check whether the
   table has any released reader or writer. A table with real readers and
   writers is `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` and backfilled, never dropped.
   A table that shipped with zero readers and zero writers in every
   released version may be dropped and recreated outright, because doing
   so cannot destroy a row that exists — this is exactly the reasoning
   `0002_test_artifacts.ts` uses for `test_annotations` (dropped and
   recreated to fix its `CHECK` constraint and remove three inline
   columns that duplicated the sibling `attachments` table) versus
   `test_artifacts` and `attachments` (widened in place with `ALTER TABLE`
   because both had gained live readers and writers in that same
   migration).[^migration-0002]
2. **Create `packages/engine/src/migrations/000N_<name>.ts`**, the next
   sequential number after the highest existing file. Export an
   `Effect.gen` migration body that runs SQL through the ambient
   `SqlClient`, following `0002_test_artifacts.ts` as the worked
   example.[^migration-0002]
3. **Register the migration in `PROJECT_MIGRATIONS`.**
   `packages/engine/src/migrations/index.ts` imports each migration module
   and lists it under its filename-derived key, in application
   order.[^migrations-index] This one record is the single source of
   truth every migration-consuming call site defaults to:
   `makeSqliteStack(filename, migrations = PROJECT_MIGRATIONS)` in
   `platform.ts`,[^engine-platform] `ensureMigrated`'s call to
   `makeSqliteStack(dbPath)`,[^ensure-migrated] and the engine's
   `testing/layers.ts` test-layer factory[^testing-layers] all resolve the
   same migration set through that one default — there is one registry to
   update, not three call sites to keep in sync.
4. **Never edit `0001_initial.ts`.** It is the record of what already ran
   on every existing install; a schema fix always ships as a new
   `000N_*.ts` file, even when the fix targets a table `0001_initial`
   introduced.
5. **Rebuild.** `pnpm build` — the engine's compiled output must include
   the new migration file before any process that imports
   `@vitest-agent/engine` picks it up.
6. **Reset the local database** so the new migration runs against a real
   `data.db` from a known-good starting point rather than being masked by
   an already-migrated dev database. See
   [Runbook: Reset the database](reset-the-database.md).
7. **Run the engine tests.** `pnpm vitest run packages/engine` (or
   `pnpm run test` for the full suite) — add or extend a migration-shape
   test alongside `migration-0002.test.ts`'s pattern so a future migration
   cannot silently regress a column or table shape this one
   introduced.[^migration-0002-test]

## Observable end state

The new migration file is registered under its key in `PROJECT_MIGRATIONS`,
`pnpm build` completes, a fresh `data.db` created after `db reset` (or the
first process to touch a missing `data.db`) ends up on the new schema
version, and `pnpm vitest run packages/engine` passes including any new
migration-shape assertions.
