# Schema migrations — append-only, one registry, never edit 0001

## Every schema change is a new `000N_*.ts` file, registered once

`packages/engine/src/migrations/index.ts` exports `PROJECT_MIGRATIONS`, an
ordered record of every migration that must run against a per-project
`data.db`, keyed by migration id (`"0001_initial"`, `"0002_test_artifacts"`,
and so on)[^migrations-index]. This is the single place a new migration is
registered. `makeSqliteStack(filename, migrations = PROJECT_MIGRATIONS)`
defaults its `migrations` parameter to that record and builds the migrator
loader from it via `SqliteMigrator.fromRecord(migrations)`[^platform], so
every consumer that calls `makeSqliteStack` with the default —
`PlatformLive`, `ensureMigrated`[^ensure-migrated],
`packages/engine/src/testing/layers.ts`'s `makeTestLayer`[^testing-layers],
and `SidecarPlatformLive` — reaches the new migration automatically the
moment it is added to `PROJECT_MIGRATIONS`. Add `0003_*.ts` and beyond;
register each one in that record, and never call `makeSqliteStack` with an
explicit second argument that is a partial or hand-picked migration list —
doing so silently strands that call site on an older schema than every
default-argument caller sees. The session-map and discovery-registry
databases are deliberately separate schemas with their own migration
records and are never touched by this one.

## Never edit `0001_initial.ts`, or any already-shipped migration, in place

`0001_initial.ts`[^migration-0001] and every migration that has shipped in a
published `@vitest-agent/engine` version are frozen. 2.x is already published
and consumers carry real `data.db` history running against those exact
migration bodies — rewriting one changes what a consumer's already-applied
migration id means, which the migrator cannot detect or recover from. A
correction to a shipped migration's intent ships as a new migration that
performs the correction, never as an edit to the file consumers already ran.

## ALTER and backfill a table that holds data; drop and recreate only a table that never accumulated any

`0002_test_artifacts.ts`[^migration-0002] is the worked example of the rule
this repository follows when a table's shape needs to change: a table that
already has real deployed data is `ALTER`ed and its existing rows are
backfilled in the same migration, never dropped, because dropping it would
discard every consumer's history. A table is only a candidate for drop-and-
recreate when it was dead — nothing had ever written a row to it in a shipped
release — so there is no data a drop would destroy.

## Breaking renames in SDK schemas, the MCP tool surface, or CLI flags are majors with changesets

A schema rename in `@vitest-agent/sdk`, a change to the MCP tool surface
(tool names, an `action`/`kind` discriminator's accepted values, a served
schema's required fields), or a CLI flag rename are breaking changes to a
public contract, not free edits alongside a migration. Each ships as a major
version bump with its own changeset naming the affected package — never
folded silently into the same commit that adds a migration file, even when
the migration and the rename are motivated by the same underlying change.
